## Entangled Bell State

### Getting Started


This first quantum program brings two qubits to one of the four simplest and maximal entangled two-qubit states, i.e the Bell state |B11>.

Namely, it implements the following quantum circuit:

which formally equates to:

You can refer to this article [C-NOT gate, Bell State and Entanglement ](https://einsteinrelativelyeasy.com/index.php/quantum-mechanics/156-c-not-gate-bell-state-and-entanglement) on my website [einsteinrelativelyeasy.com](https://einsteinrelativelyeasy.com/) to refresh your memory about this formalism.

And you may also find it useful to read this article [Introduction-to-entanglement](https://einsteinrelativelyeasy.com/index.php/quantum-mechanics/147-introduction-to-entanglement) to give you an overall view of entanglement and to remind you that an entanglement state **can not be written as product state**.
