# Quantum Mechanics Python
This project provides a Python implementation of some well-known quantum algorithms as introduced in the `Quantum Mechanics` section of our web site [einsteinrelativelyeasy.com](https://einsteinrelativelyeasy.com/index.php/quantum-mechanics).

As for now, it provides the implementation of:
- [Teleportation Algorithm](teleportation)

It uses the quantum python Google [API Cirq](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

Follow the instructions and read the documentation of each sub-project:
